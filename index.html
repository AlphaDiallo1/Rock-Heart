            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm currently new to HTML and CSS, but I had an amazing time building this website. I recently completed my associate's degree, but I realized there was so much more to explore. When my cousin introduced me to Thinkful, I thought it was an amazing opportunity. I'm determined to become a skilled coder, and I'm committed to working on it every day to achieve my goals. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring Staten Island, New York, Professional Wrestling, and Anime. Feel free to connect with me through the links below!</p>

            <p>My future is filled with exciting aspirations. I aim to become a skilled software engineer and contribute to innovative projects. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and growth in the world of coding.</p>
