            <img src="IMG_5377.jpg" width="500" alt="Alpha Diallo">
            <p>I'm currently new to HTML and CSS, but I had an amazing time building this website. I recently completed my associate's degree, but I realized there was so much more to explore. When my cousin introduced me to Thinkful, I thought it was an amazing opportunity. I'm determined to become a skilled coder, and I'm committed to working on it every day to achieve my goals. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring Staten Island, New York, Professional Wrestling, and Anime. Feel free to connect with me through the links below!</p>
